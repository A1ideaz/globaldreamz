<h3 class="head">Student with Admits from American University, George Washington University &amp; Bentley College</h3>
<p style="">Hmmm Well. So. Phew. How do I start this 
testimonial..!!??? Trust me; I was a thousand times more confused a year
 back, especially when it was about deciding my future. Fortunately, I 
was referred to Mr. Suresh by one of my good friends. I am someone who 
had many dreams, backed by good academics and sound work experience with
 one of the India's IT majors. However, the thing I lacked was, TIME. 
Every time I prepared for my GMAT, some work commitment followed and 
ultimately messed up my preparations, not one but twice. With an average
 GMAT score, I was so confused that I was at the brink of giving up my 
dreams.</p>
<p style="">In such a pathetic phase, the first thing that
 Mr. Suresh offered was the confidence that I can still make it. At 
every milestone through my pursuit for an admission, be it editing the 
essays, application processing, interviews, etc, I would always reach 
out to Suresh with some confusions, and always got back thinking, yes 
this man will take me through this process, and I will be a part of a 
respectable school this Fall. <strong>He has a methodical approach, yet 
is always prepared to go that extra mile to look for better options. I 
was contemplating a lot and hence delayed my application processing, by 
which time most of the better school's deadlines were over. Despite all 
this and for a profile like mine, he could still come up with an array 
of respectable schools which by itself explains the enormous groundwork 
he does to understand his student's profile and the experience/knowledge
 he carries. I could appreciate this even more when I could convert four
 of my seven applications into admits. </strong>I had one more interview
 call too. Now that I have told you about the interview, I should also 
tell his efforts in getting his students prepared for interviews. No 
matter how late it is, or whether he is in Chennai or Bangalore, he 
makes it a point that a mock interview session is done and the student 
at least knows the mistakes he makes, so that just by avoiding them the 
student can score those extra brownie points. The part of his service to
 make you VISA ready is another highlight. His workshop to get VISA 
ready is priceless. Do not be stunned if you get an invite stating a 
session for 6 hours, trust me u will never realize how and when the 6 
hours went by.</p>
<p style="">There is one more important person in Suresh's Team. Mrs. Devi, his better half. <strong>Framing
 the plan, Zeroing on universities, getting the essays completed is one 
part, but the often under rated part is to find out what the university 
wants, what are the deadlines, and to systematically follow up. Mrs. 
Devi is the best in this. I am sure it is a lot tougher than what it 
was, all credit to her to make it that way.</strong> I have seen a lot 
of people crib/fear filling up the VISA forms; it happened to me within 5
 minutes, all credit to the master. She knows what exactly has to be 
done.</p>
<p style="">To conclude, just like any student, despite me
 being all set for an exciting graduate program, there are some minor 
WHAT-IFs in my mind. However, I TRUST in Suresh, more than him, I trust 
his service, am sure if at all, I have a problem to be sorted out, I 
know whom I should get in touch for, Mr. Suresh is mostly online ready 
for any expert advice. Thanks a lot Suresh. Devi and you have been a big
 help to me in my pursuit. Wishing Devi, you, your team and Global 
Dreamz all the very best for a great future.</p>

<h3 class="head">Students with admits from UIUC, William &amp; Mary, Virginia Tech </h3>
<p style="">To - All the ambivalent cat-on-the-walls (like me)<br>
I still remember the period when I was in two minds about doing my PG 
abroad. I had a pretty decent GMAT score, 2 yrs of work ex for an IT 
company and nothing much extra that I could boast about. The fluctuating
 economic situation last year didn't help matters either. That's when I 
was introduced by a friend to Suresh of Global Dreamz. When we met for 
one and half hours he just let me speak my mind and prompted me to shoot
 all kinds of questions at him. At the end of the discussion, I had made
 up my mind to do my MBA abroad and I have never looked back ever since.</p>
<p style=""><strong>I joined Global Dreamz as well as 
Princeton Review so that I can get the best of both worlds, but sadly 
Princeton's services didn't stand upto the legacy they claim. On the 
other hand, I was quite at home with Suresh's team. The application 
process was a mutually learning experience for us and my admission with 
full scholarship into a University that is ranked no 79 in FT, sums up 
the fruits of our labor.</strong> I also had admits with scholarship 
from UIUC and Vtech (Pamplin), but I decided to join the College of 
William and Mary in Virginia.</p>
<p style="">The help and support extended by Global Dreamz
 didn't end with my admission, but carried on to the other crucial 
aspects such as the Visa process and the pre-departure planning. Their 
Visa workshop was very thorough and their pre-departure seminar 
reiterated the importance of getting accustomed to a foreign setting. My
 application/admission/departure was a well-planned one with few unseen 
obstacles. <strong>The most important aspect of my experience with 
Suresh's team is the little or no pressure that my parents had to face, 
as we were able to solve all problems between ourselves and spare them 
the anguish</strong>.</p>
<p style="">In every business, maintaining quality after 
tasting success and recognition is the biggest challenge and I wish 
Global Dreamz every success in helping realize numerous other dreams 
with the same zeal and effort that went into realizing mine. Cheers!!!

<h3 class="head">Student with admits fro U of Arizona, U of Illinois &amp; George Washington Univ</h3>
<p style="">After a lot of thought I have decided that it 
would be unfair on my part to write a testimonial for "Global Dreamz" on
 the whole and hence I'm writing it for the individuals, Mr. Suresh 
&amp; his better half, Ms. Devi Suresh who form the pillars of "Global 
Dreamz".</p>
<p style=""><strong>Mr. Suresh - The Man who runs the 
show. He is a sort of a person who can impress you in your first meeting
 with him. I still do not understand how he strikes chord with everybody
 instantly, be it a student or their parents</strong>. I can still 
remember the day when I met him for the first time after giving my GMAT.
 As a prospective student I had lot of questions lingering in my mind 
right from the course I wanted to pursue to the Universities that I 
wanted to apply. He immediately started working with me understanding 
what I wanted and started discussing the prospective Universities that I
 would be applying to. I was totally floored at that moment and I knew 
that I was in safe hands. Today, I'm sitting with three admits from the 
University of Arizona, University of Illinois, George Washington 
University for MS in Management Information Systems. It is all because 
of him. Thank you Mr. Suresh.</p>
<p style="">Ms. Devi Suresh - "Behind the Success of every man there is a woman". This quote is very apt for this couple. <strong>Before
 meeting her I was under the impression that she was not part of "Global
 Dreamz" but I was totally wrong. It is she who runs the show from 
behind. I can guarantee you 100% that she does most of the work during 
your application process. She would be the one who would be sitting with
 you throughout most of the times. So, if you want your application to 
get done asap then the secret is acquaint her else you're in soup for 
sure</strong>.</p>
<p style="">So, on the whole it's been wonderful journey 
for me with them. I owe them a lot and I'm glad that I had an 
opportunity to work with them.</p>

California and Univ of Toronto Canada</h3>
<p style="">Suresh is the master of his game. From 
applying to the right universities till the moment you depart, he'll be 
right by your side, walk you on the perfect path and make all the work 
as easy and fun as possible. The best thing about him is that he's 
almost ALWAYS available to help his students out, not matter how small 
or big the problem, his willingness to spend time is amazing. He will be
 up till midnight discussing topics for essays or will make time for an 
appointment at 7 in the morning if necessary. All this combined with his
 long years of experience is the best you can get.</p>
<p style=""><strong>Suresh adds the perfect personal touch
 to his work. Every application to a university needs to be personal 
which he helps in indentifying and portraying to the university. He 
maintains the perfect balance of being a friend, a guide and the tough 
task master where need be, which brings out the best in students and to 
my surprise easily improves upon i</strong>t. As an undergrad aspirant, I
 had many parameters that had to be catered to. The limited exposure and
 the unlimited curiosity kept throwing up various options and hurdles. 
Be it for the university short listing, essay editing, admissions 
interview or visa interview I was keen on adding my personal preferences
 and gloating my little experiences. Suresh blended my successes, needs 
and aspirations in each process and came out with results that best 
reflected me!</p>
<p style="">Making an undergrad understand the maze of 
visa process, I am sure many would have preferred to bypass. With my 
father working out of town, I didn't want to venture into the whole 
process all by myself. That's when I received his email about the '6 
hours long visa workshop' and that was the best thing that had happened 
to me. By the end of the workshop I was talking financials with my dad, 
something that I had never done until date. <strong>At this point it's 
imperative for me to note that I had also enrolled with another 
consultant popularly known as TPR. I can definitely vouch that Suresh's 
expertise, experience and passion to serve students was unmatched! Today
 I have been admitted into top undergrad schools despite me not 
possessing the top profile scores. And the credit obviously goes to 
Suresh and his team</strong>.</p>
<p style="">Simply put "They help you rock!" I wish that 
many more students seek his services and be immensely benefitted like 
me. I pray that God Stay With You Always.</p>

<p style="">Well, I still remember the night on October 
13, 2008 when I stood outside the ETS testing centre with my GRE having 
taken and no practical idea of what has to be done next. The next few 
days were blank until I met one of my friends who told me about Mr. 
Suresh and Global Dreamz. The Same day I met him and Devi mam. To my 
astonishment, he had short listed a bunch of universities that suited my
 profile the very same day itself though I wasn't enrolled into Global 
Dreamz. When a lot of private consultants don't even share their ideas 
without a penny being spent, Mr. Suresh had gone to an extent of sharing
 with us a lot of information the very first day we met.That is when I 
decided to step into the doors of Global Dreamz. Well, the journey that 
followed was coupled with information and Success.</p>
<p style="">The application process, I should say was 
something way too different. I had heard from my friends that their 
consultants had got all the information from them, filled the 
applications on their behalf and only mentioned their status back to 
them after 3 months. <strong>Here, we filled our applications, wrote our
 Resume and SOPs, and segregated our documents while Mr. Suresh guided 
us through. By doing this I was contented that I had understood the A-Z 
of the process. Well, this was Mr. Suresh's Strategy too. He made us 
realize how things were done. I had almost received admits from all the 
universities I applied to. Thanks to Mr. Suresh's perfect analysis of my
 profile with Universities. </strong>I also thank Devi mam for her 
assistance in my application process. Well, I can't go without 
mentioning the fact that both Mr. Suresh and Devi mam would spend time 
with us even beyond 10 pm in the night during our application processes.
 This is something I feel that makes them stand apart from the rest. 
Hats Off to you both!!</p>
<p style=""><strong>The one very specialty about Mr. 
Suresh is the amount of knowledge he possessed and another specialty of 
Global Dreamz is that here, unlike anywhere else we directly interact 
with the brains that possessed loads of data. It is a centralized system
 where everything routes to one huge database, Mr. Suresh. </strong>When
 I used to visit him, I would sit there for hours listening to the 
information that he would deliver. This is something that I appreciated a
 lot because once I went to a meeting where my prospective college mates
 had gathered. One of our college seniors had also come there to address
 us. It was me who had shared a lot of information with my college mates
 and frankly speaking they were really surprised to see me coming out 
with so much of knowledge. My senior answered questions related to the 
university whereas I dominated when general questions were raised. 
Thanks to Mr. Suresh and his Laptop.</p>
<p style="">When it was time for the Visa, Mr. Suresh and 
Devi mam helped us a lot. He would ask us to first explore our own 
resources in order to collect certain documents. By this, he made us 
realize our own strengths and weaknesses. I always remember him saying 
"I make you do all these by yourself so that you stand in front of the 
Visa officer with full confidence". Well, he definitely had a lot of 
safe alternatives too. His main objective was that we receive our Visas 
without any hassles. His Workshop "Acing the Visa Interview" had 
answered a lot of queries with respect to Visa interview. He made it a 
point that it was not just a seminar but an active workshop. His seminar
 on Pre-Departure Orientation was one you shouldn't dare missing because
 he explained everything that we would encounter in America in a crystal
 clear manner with illustrations from his students who were already 
studying abroad. He also shared ideas about OPT, CPT, H1B (which is a 
hot topic) with us. These are information which no one else would 
provide for sure.</p>
<p style="">Finally, here I stand today all excited with 
my token to enter United States. It was a good 9 months relationship 
with Global Dreamz and I am very confident that this doesn't end here. I
 am leaving to US with the hope that if at any point of time I face an 
issue I have Mr. Suresh and Devi mam to whom I can route back for a 
suggestion. I wish them all the best in the years to come.</p>

<h3 class="head">Student with Admits from Virginia Tech, Thunderbird and William &amp; Mary</h3>
<p style="">My road to MBA is just as good as it got and 
after so much initial setbacks and hiccups, I couldn't have asked for 
anything better than this. Let me rewind my application process to the 
early stage. I belonged to the group that thinks 'high GMAT score will 
get you through to a higher ranked better university'. But only after my
 GMAT, I realized that high GMAT is just one among the seven important 
criteria that universities generally look for. So, then came the hunt 
for a reliable, well-informed and knowledge Consultant who would assist 
me in realizing my MBA dream. In the due course, I interacted with 
consultants from reputed consultancies. One suggested me to go for 
Melbourne University and I asked him "why". His answer crashed my hopes 
and posted a bigger threat to my hunt for a good consultant. Here goes 
his reply: "Jai, I suggest you go for Melbourne University as Canada is 
one of the finest places in the world to live and Melbourne is 
geographically located at centre of Canada. So you can have fun and have
 great experience while you do your MBA." How am I supposed to react to 
this???? I smiled and said "Even my Uncle resides in Melbourne, Canada. 
 So I will have even more fun and left the place." Not to mention, I 
encountered many such kind of consultants more than once. I was very 
dejected then that consultants will play only a bit in application 
process. So I joined a well renowned consultancy and paid Rs. 34,000. 
Only after this I realized that it was even worse than what I had 
assumed it would be. The counsellor over there would short list the 
schools for us just based on the US News ranking. And then the Essay 
editor was even worse. She would take a week's time to add one sentence
 to the essay and finally reply that my Essay is ready for submission. I
 even thought of shifting my goals from MBA to Admission Consultant, as 
considering the situation, I felt I would be better skilled than 90% of 
such consultants out there in our country today.</p>
<p style="">Then came this most refreshing moment in life 
wherein I got a chance to meet Mr. Suresh and his team. Right after the 
first discussion with him, I thought I could afford for Suresh that 
34,000, I paid to that so called renowned consultancy. How would you 
feel when your Admission consultant works with you on your essay till 
11.30 pm and even on weekends? It was quite a wonderful experience I had
 with Mr. Suresh. <strong>He is not a person who speaks honey coated 
words but does nothing practically. First time when I gave him my list 
of Universities, he directly said "You may not get into 3 of these 
Universities". I was really surprised but very happy that he was being 
straight-forward else I would have wasted my time and money for 
something which, for sure, is beyond my reach and highly ambitious. 
Quality of a consultant is reflected by his experience, how informed he 
is about the current happenings in the universities apart from being 
straight forward to the students and I can vouch that he meets all these
 criteria.</strong> No matter what question I shot, Mr. Suresh always 
came with a perfect answer. Sessions such as Visa Workshops, 
Pre-Departure Orientation helped me get rid of the doubts that I had 
then about Visas and other important aspects of getting to the 
University. Who would spend 6 hours just to enlighten students about 
VISA?? Mr. Suresh did.</p>
<p style="">Not to mention, I reached US 3 days back and 
at the JFK airport's Immigration counter, when I uttered "The College of
 William &amp; Mary", the American who was on that counter spoke for 5 
mins about my University and about former US presidents who studied in 
this second oldest university in US. Now I know where I am. Its 12:45 AM
 here at Virginia but I feel Mr.Suresh deserves this testimonial, 
irrespective of the time. Thanks Mr. Suresh and Global Dreamz for 
helping me realize my dream. Keep up the good work.</p>

<h3 class="head">Student pursuing Masters at Purdue University </h3>
<p style="">I will never forget that fine day in august 
2008 when I walked into the Global Dreamz office with loads of doubts 
and I remember the way I stepped out of it 30 minutes later, very 
confident and was assured that I chose the right consultants. It took 
just 30 minutes of time for Suresh to completely change the way I looked
 at GMAT and the American MBA Dream. It was never a dream again for me 
as I was sure that this man would help me realize it provided I get a 
good score. Writing GMAT is the only task which you need to do alone. In
 rest of all he would be with you with his expert guidance making the 
tasks all the more simple. <strong>In short I put it as, "You do your job  he will do his job lot better"</strong></p>
<p style="">What I like in him is the way he organizes his
 work and makes the total process crystal clear. I always believe that 
"working hard is not the key to success, but working smart is the key". 
Smart work is what Suresh is so good at. The way he helps you strategize
 your essays is simply awesome, thus he brings in your originality in 
the essays unlike many other consultants who have essay prototypes and 
make you look like some X in the essay. Suresh edits the essay in such a
 fashion that they depict your personality. Right from the selection of 
universities to the pre departure seminar he takes care of the student 
with great personal interest.</p>
<p style="">The VISA Seminar organized by him deserves a 
huge applause. It was so comprehensive that it clears every speck of 
doubt about the visa process. He makes you work hard on your 
documentation and takes care that it is so perfect that the Visa Officer
 has to grant you the visa at any cost once he decides to look at your 
documents. I should mention here about the mock visa interview that we 
had in a group (around 8 people) 3 days before the visa where I had 
enough interview experience beforehand. I was sure that my visa is just 2
 minutes away from the time I meet the Visa Officer.</p>
<p style=""><strong>And I should mention here about Mrs. 
Devi Suresh, his ideal partner who supports him in his work and who 
maintains a constant check of application status of every student, and 
reminds you very patiently about the documents that you need to furnish.
 I relied on her so heavily that I even made her to fill in my visa 
application and block my visa date. So good is she in her own field of 
work! They support each other well and provide a great moral support for
 every student</strong>. Their warm reception makes you feel that you 
are at your home and in very short span of time they became very good 
friends whom I can rely on for life time. This made me even more 
comfortable in doing my work.</p>
<p style="">I sincerely thank Global Dreamz for the 
magnificent support they had given me from the past 10 months and I wish
 them great success in their future endeavours and I am sure they will 
reach the paramount. <strong>To all the people who are still pondering 
on choosing their Career Consultants, I like to say this "You people are
 in the right office and with the right person whose immense experience 
would make this long process a successful and most memorable one"</strong>.</p>

<h3 class="head">Student with Admits from UMiami, Rensselaer Poly - Lally, etc</h3>
<p style="">Study Abroad - A dream of numerous Indian 
students, a deceptive and composite dream which requires vast and 
precise knowledge of a myriad of facts - and to guide me through this 
maze I chose Global Dreamz and I'm happy that I made the best choice. 
Mr. Suresh with his knowledge on various Universities and their complex 
procedures made the entire mazy process look a lot simpler. He was there
 to help and guide me in every step I took - be it the choice of the 
universities, drafting my essays, completing my applications, preparing 
for my interviews etc. He showed the responsibility of a parent, an 
approach of a friend and the touch of a master.<strong> His methodical 
and tactical approach of helping me draft my essays popeyed me. He 
helped me draft essays from the experiences of my own life - something 
which gave me a confidence on my candidacy. He made anecdotes from 
incidents which I often presumed trivial and this gave a personal and a 
distinctive touch to my essays. His seminars on the Visa procedures and 
the Pre-departure activities were highly illuminating. He is a person of
 actions and not words.</strong></p>
<p style="">Global Dreamz do not offer consultation, 
instead they provide guidance. I was always given a personal attention 
with no distractions and was provided audience at times of my choice to 
suit my needs. They were times when Mr. Suresh sat with me for hours 
even odd hours just because I could adjust with my work schedule - 
something which is not the norm in other places. <strong>After all 
Global Dreamz was recommended by a friend and now I realize why many 
students trust them with not just their money but their dreams and 
future</strong>.</p>
</li><br />
<li>
<h3 class="head">Student at Univ of Illinois - UC</h3>
<p style="">I have wondered many a times when people say 
"This person XYZ was god sent. I don't know what would have I done 
without him/her". Are they exaggerating? And now I find myself saying 
"Both Mr. and Mrs. Suresh were god sent. I don't know what would have I 
done without them". And of course, I am not exaggerating! After my 
unsuccessful attempt to get help from one of the renowned admission 
counselling centre in spite of paying an exorbitant fee, I was 
desperate. There was a point where I had doubted whether I will be able 
to join the forthcoming Fall as it was already December and had not 
started any of the application processes. It was then I came to know 
about Global Dreamz. <strong>After speaking with Mr. Suresh from Global 
Dreamz I decided to let go all the money I had paid to the earlier 
admission counseling centre. I was confident that I had come to right 
place after discussing with Mr. Suresh and trust me everyone who has 
received guidance from him would agree with me. There are no false 
promises made so you are assured of what you are truly worth.</strong></p>
<p style="">In a month's time I had completed my 
application process starting from selection of universities, writing 
essays, getting LOR, completing online application etc. I had never felt
 overburdened although I used to come home late from office. This is 
because I was clearly directed by them as in what is expected to be 
completed for the application to be sent with all the required 
information also being given by them. <strong>The best part is "THE 
MATRIX CONCEPT"-writing dozens of essays can never be this easier. 
Although your GRE/GMAT score play a vital role in securing admission at 
the top schools, it is the Essay that would actually speak on our behalf
 and aid in not just securing an admission but also an "ADMISSION WITH 
SCHOLARSHIP/FUNDING"</strong>. With dedicated counselling from Mrs. Devi
 Suresh one need not worry about completing online applications, sending
 of materials to schools etc. Their care and attention to their student 
does not stop there. You should not be surprised if you receive a call 
from them at any time of the day because they would be calling to inform
 you about your successful admission into your dream colleges. </p>
<p style="">After the admission, comes the biggest hurdle 
of all times - the VISA. The Visa workshop conducted by Mr. Suresh was a
 real eye-opener. Many unanswered questions about financial statements, 
academic related etc were answered then. From booking of Visa 
appointments, paying of SEVIS fee to completing my Visa interview I was 
able to complete them without any hassles and Voila! I got my Visa! 
Then, the pre-departure orientation session was held, I realized that 
getting a Visa is not the final stop but there is still a long way to go
 to land in U.S.A without any musses. Last but not the least; you will 
not land in U.S.A and feel stranded, as you get to know many people 
through Mr. Suresh J</p>
<p style="">I walked out of Global Dreams happy having met
 not only a good consultant/mentor but also great friends as they are 
someone whom I can rely on always.</p>

<p style="">I am extremely glad to write this testimonial 
to Mr. Suresh and Mrs. Devi Suresh who helped me to switch my dream into
 subsistence. Initially I was desperate about pursuing M.S at USA; it 
remained as a high time dream alone. Fortunately I learnt about GLOBAL 
DREAMZ Consultancy through one of my friends. At first I made a phone 
call to Mr. Suresh and introduced myself and he asked me to visit him at
 his residence here in Chennai. I was really petrified about 
consultancies hearing a lot about them from students who went abroad but
 guess what?? <strong>Global Dreamz is a Ray of optimism laden with self-confidence and obviously the reason being Mr. &amp; Mrs. Suresh</strong></p>
<p style="">I had a very low GRE score and thought I could
 not make it in any university at USA. Mr. Suresh encouraged me and gave
 a positive speech that "GRE "scores alone will not be considered to 
judge a student and its one of the factors. Moreover he assured me I 
could get the course which I desired because I had a decent TOEFL and 
good Academics. These words of encouragement from him were the real 
boosters for my confidence table. They have got a simple and fabulous 
process for all students which will suit their profile. <strong>Planning and sticking onto the right path ahead of the stipulated time is the first thing I learnt from Mr &amp; Mrs Suresh.</strong></p>
<p style="">In almost a week's time he short listed the US
 universities according to my profile and I started to apply for the 
universities online. Folks this is the stage that no one could ever 
forget Mrs. Devi Suresh. You can ask any number of doubts and questions 
that will arise while you fill up your online application and she is 
always there beside you to help and guide. She is really fast and 
sweet!! They undertake all courier services to and from the University 
of your Choice. Within three months time all the admission results were 
notified to me through e-mail and the respective I 20's were sent to my 
residential address. I would like to mention that I got 50% aid for the 
first year at University of Bridgeport, the type of aid I received is 
Graduate assistantship. I was extremely delighted like anyone would be 
and I thank Mr. Suresh without whom I would have not applied to that 
university. That's all folks a big initially step (Phase I) got over.</p>
<p style="">Next is Phase II which will be really 
devastating which is none other than the "VISA ". Lots of procedures and
 paper works to be done, but again Global Dreamz offered easy visa 
guidance by conducting the six hour VISA workshop from which I benefited
 a lot. The workshop covered everything right from Visa interview 
questions, body language, the voice modulation to maintain, documents to
 carry, till booking up the interview date. It all didn't stop with the 
visa workshop, but I went and met Mr. Suresh many times after that to 
clarify my doubts. Mr Suresh also conducted a question &amp; answer 
round for all his students attending the Visa interview for Fall 09, it 
really helped each and every one of us because we got all our doubts 
cleared as well as learnt how to answer for each visa question that we 
might encounter.</p>
<p style="">Once I got my Visa approved, then the next 
event I participated at GLOBAL DREAMZ is the pre-departure workshop. It 
was too good and was laden with all necessary information that one would
 like to know while you land up at your destination.<strong> I would 
like to conclude by saying that GLOBAL DREAMZ will propel you to the 
education destination of your choice and make your dream come true.</strong></p>

from where they are to where they have not been" - Henry Kissinger, 56th
 Secretary of State of the United States, 1973 to 1977.</p>
<p style="">Walking down the memory lane, the journey I 
have taken to get an admit into UAH along with a Presidential 
Scholarship has been very eventful. Eleven months, where did they go? 
There are a hundred things I learnt and a thousand occasions I enjoyed 
in these months. Today I find myself on the other end of the road from 
where I had started.</p>
<p style="">Blue was the day when I gave my GRE, down with
 a meagre score, none can imagine the disappointment I felt. But the 
silver lining was the words of encouragement from you Sir. Problems came
 flooding from nowhere; right from my passport application, GRE score 
reporting, etc to the final Visa application form filling. <strong>But 
your guidance and inspiration have taught me that if you are optimistic,
 no task would be a challenge to dip you down in the ocean of depression
 or set you in the sea of stress; It all depends on how you look at the 
problem, So be positive and stamp your feet on all that is negative. 
This is exactly what I have been drawing from you, during each of our 
meetings. I have bugged you on a number of occasions but you have been 
my guide and friend and put me on the right track each time.</strong> Thanks a bunch Sir.</p>
<p style="">Words fail me when I try to describe Devi Mam.
 Her exceptional care and concern for her candidates have left me spell 
bound. Her sunny smile and her patient friendly attitude are ever 
evident. <strong>Young at heart, fun loving and enthusiastic she blends 
with people so well. I remember her meticulous way of scanning my 
application forms. I have to say it Mam, without you the whole process 
would have been a disaster. I dearly appreciate your concern and 
support.</strong></p>
<p style="">There is no exaggeration in the saying of 
Henry Ford, "Coming together is a beginning, staying together is 
progress, and working together is success". Indeed u both have gone out 
of your way to be with me in my struggle and have helped me achieve this
 success. I owe you a lot. I really do..<br>
Goodbyes are not for ever; Goodbyes are not the end They simply mean I 
miss you Until we meet again. Let's keep this good relationship going. 
I'm sure I'm going to run back to you for help. I wholeheartedly wish 
Global Dreamz to propel many more dreamz to greater heights. God Bless </p>
