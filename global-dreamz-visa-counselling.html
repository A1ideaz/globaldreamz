			<h2>Visa Counseling</h2><br />
<p>For many of us the thrill of going abroad is beyond words. It is the culmination of years of hard work and sincere effort to pursue goals that were meant to be achieved. Travel abroad can be to study, to work, to visit a kith or kin, sight see and/or to join the spouse and hence the joy of travelling is generally boundless. However as saying goes, “no pain, no gain”, travel abroad necessitates seeking a visa from the embassy before the journey can be performed.</p>

<p>We at Global Dreamz under take to guide you through the complicated maze of visa process in terms securing appointments (where need be) guiding on documents to be carried (according to your visa category with emphasis on you carrying your original documents) and helping out with visa interview process (depending on the embassy requirements). Our services also extend beyond the visa and we would be able to arrange for necessary loans, forex, insurance and ticketing if need be.
</p>

<p>Our experts lay lot of emphasis on careful documentation with producing your original documents as the embassy officials would prefer to see original documents. Likewise while preparing you for the interviews our visa experts would help you in explaining your views and needs to travel abroad as they are quiet particular about hearing the original reason in your words.
</p>

<p>Our recent success includes securing visas for spouse, visas for professionals from the medical and legal back ground. In the last year we have helped many reach the shores of USA, Canada, UK, Germany, Singapore, Spain, France and such great destinations.
<br />
Call on us and you would realize why you need to partner with us to secure your dreamz.
