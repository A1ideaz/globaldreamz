			<h2>Countries & Opportunities</h2><br />
            <p>Students planning to study abroad are generally advised  to carefully choose their final destination. The country that one would want to  study at should also pave way for realizing their career dreamz. And then, its  common knowledge that nothing would suffice as much as an education in Detroit  for a Mechanical Engineer, Switzerland for Hotel Management, UK for  Biosciences, etc., and thus choosing do the right program not only from the  right university but also from the right country gains significance.
            <p>Currently the following countries top the list of  favorite destination for students from across the world:-</p>
            <h3>USA</h3>
            <p>Considered as the world&rsquo;s Mecca for studies and  scholarships; USA still attracts the most number of students. US education is  characterized by it&rsquo;s flexibility in allowing the student to choose the  program/courses, its highly qualified faculty base, the plethora of  assistantships, myriad financial aid schemes and the promise of good jobs for  the deserving.&nbsp; The learning methodology  that they pioneered has helped them stay ahead of the curve.</p>
            <h3>Canada</h3>
            <p>Regarded as USA&rsquo;s sibling in adopting US standards on  education, Canada offers all USA offers to its students and more than that. On  certain factors like 1 year P.G Degree courses, Diploma and P.G Diploma courses,  Co-op programs Canada is known to be ahead of US counterparts. However the  climate, scarce financial aid resources and the long visa process deter many  students.</p>
            <h3>Sweden</h3>
            <p>Is suddenly high on the map of those serious about a  Masters/Ph.D in sciences and engineering! The highly qualified faculty, the  emphasis or research, the diversity of students, the class room, the highly  diverse international student body, etc are attracting more students to Sweden.  The promise of Blue card which has been on cards for sometime has further added  to the rush.</p>
            <h3>United  Kingdom</h3>
            <p>UK has been yet another favorite destination of students  to pursue their masters. Most of the masters program in UK take less than a  year to complete and thus is quite popular amongst people with work experience.  However lack of adequate job opportunities makes it less exciting and the  recent developments (between 2009 and 2012) have only added to the negativity  of pursuing higher studies in this country.</p>
            <h3>Australia</h3>
            <p>Though a late entrant has manage to capture the interest  of Indian students through its non-interview visa process and non-emphasis on  TOEFL for securing visas to pursue studies in Australia. However sudden changes  in the visa process and lack of good career opportunities for non-engineering  students have made many wary about Australia as their destination.<br />
              Other Countries like Singapore, China and Hong Kong in Asia; France, Italy and  Spain in Europe; and other countries like South Africa, Dubai, etc., are all  emerging as destinations for higher studies abroad. However for those serious  about good post qualification prospects choosing the major destinations would  help them in the long run.<br />
