			<h2>Career Counseling</h2><br />
<p>Job satisfaction is the best measure of one's realization of dreamz. Job satisfaction is mostly attained by pursuing a career of one’s interest and one’s passion. Thus identifying your interest and passion becomes the key to success, which is dictated by your ability to raise to the demands of your passion. Understanding your attitude, aptitude and reasoning skills therefore becomes vital to success.
<br /><br />
Career Counselling is therefore vital for the following sets of people:</p>

<p><b>Students:</b><br />

To understand your attitude and aptitude you may have to try various psychometric and psychoanalytical tests which would indicate careers/professions that would best fit you. You are there after at liberty to home skills according to the demands of these choices or develop/acquire new skills which would otherwise help you pursue a career of your choice.
</p>

<p><b>Career Enhancers:</b><br />

For those who would be interested in enhancing their career progression, but are clueless about how and what skills to be acquired for moving up the corporate  ladder swiftly, career counseling acts as a vital source of information and serves as a road map towards their long term goals. Such counseling bridges the gap between your aspirations and current capabilities as well as clearly defines the steps to be undertaken for achieving your career goals.
</p>
